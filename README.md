# Cats have quite the purr-sonality!

ok, ok I'll stop with the puns. After all, with the right catitude, anything is pawsible! Ok, fine, I'll REALLY stop now :) 

This is a cat website I made after learning how to use HTML and CSS. The files that have FINAL_WEBSITE are the pages for my website. The rest are the practice files, from which I was able to implement a lot of ideas into my final project! 

This was my first project - ever - using HTML and CSS (pls be considerate (T_T) ) but I was still able to perservere and make it till the end!
